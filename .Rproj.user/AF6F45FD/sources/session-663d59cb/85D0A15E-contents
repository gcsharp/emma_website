# **Welcome to EMMA, a study of Women's Health by the University of Exeter**

You are invited to take part in this academic research study. Before you decide whether or not to participate in this study, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take the time to read the following information carefully.

## Purpose of the research

Compared to research on men, there has been very little research on the health and wellbeing of women. There is an urgent need to bridge the gap by collecting more high quality data on women, and conducting more research to better understand how to maximise their health.

The aim of the EMMA study is to establish whether it is feasible to use a technique called Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to collect data on women's health for future research. The technique involves using smart technology (a phone app and a smartwatch) to collect daily measures of health and wellbeing over a 3-month period.

We want to see how well participants engage with the study, and understand their experiences of taking part. This will help us understand whether we need to make any changes to the study protocol before it is used in future research.

## Who is doing this research?

The lead researcher of this study is Jessica Brookman, an MSc Student on the Psychological Research Methods course in the Psychology Department at the University of Exeter. This project is being supervised by Dr Gemma Sharp, Associate Professor at the University of Exeter.

## Ethical review of this research

This study has been reviewed and approved by the University of Exeter Research Ethics Committee. The Chairs of the Ethics Committee may be contacted by email: Ciro Civile ([c.civile\@ex.ac.uk](mailto:c.civile@ex.ac.uk){.email}) or Ian McLaren ([i.p.l.mclaren\@ex.ac.uk](mailto:i.p.l.mclaren@ex.ac.uk){.email})

## What participants will be asked to do

The study will take place over a 3-month period, requiring daily input onto an mobile phone app (Mesmerise), which should take no more than 5 minutes, twice a day. You will also be asked to wear a smart watch (provided by the research team), to monitor your heart rate throughout the study. Therefore, you will need to be local to Exeter to enable to collection and return of this device (from the Washington Singer building, Streatham Campus, University of Exeter).

On the next tab, you can check whether you're eligible to participate in this study. If you are, you will be asked a series of short questions designed to gather data on your current physical and mental health. This should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.

Once we have received this, we will contact you via email to confirm whether you still want to participate, and we will provide you with a link to download the Mesmerise smartphone app and join the study. On Mesmerise, you will be prompted twice a day to complete your daily questionnaires, and once a week to complete an additional short weekly questionnaire. Each questionniare should only take a couple of minutes. We will also arrange (via email) for you to collect a smartwatch. When you come to collect the smartwatch, we will explain how to use it to collect heart rate data. We will also explain how you can download the data and send it to us at the end of the study.

At the end of the 3-month period, you will be asked to complete a final questionnaire, where we will ask for your honest feedback on what it was like to be a participant in this study. This will allow us to guide future research using similar methodology.

All personal data collected will be anonymised and will not be traceable back to you. Data will be stored in line with GDPR guidelines, and you can opt-out of having your data stored if you so wish.

## Payment for research

We estimate it will take no more than 10 minutes a day to complete the questionnaires, and the study lasts for three months. If you participate, you will receive a Â£10 Amazon voucher on completion. If you drop out of the study part way through, you will still receive this payment. However, if you drop out prior to beginning the EMA aspect of the study, no compensation will be provided.

## Benefits and risks of taking part

Participating in this study will aid future research into Women's Health, with the hope of improving health outcomes for all women and people who menstruate. The present research will act as a guide for future research in this field, so participating in this research will enable us to learn what works for you as participants to make future research the best experience possible for participants whilst yielding good quality data.

There are no direct risks involved with participating in this study. You should be aware that there is always a potential risk to confidentiality, but this will be mitigated by all data being anonymised and securely stored according to GDPR guidelines. Please note that it is extremely unlikely that there would be any breach of your data, but should this occur, you will be notified immediately.

## Voluntary participation and your right to withdraw

Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You are under no obligation to take part and you may stop at any time.

## Data management

Your data will be fully anonymised prior to the project write-up. Data will be retained for up to 5 years in line with GDPR guidelines. Data may be used in future research into Women's Health. It is most likely that the data from this project will be used only by the supervisor of the current project. Any other researchers wishing to use the Mesmerise data will be required to contact the supervisor. They will only be granted access if they are a bona fide researcher and their project is approved by the supervisor and the ethics committee. They will then sign a data transfer agreement that requires them to respect the confidential nature of the data and prevents further sharing and any attempt to identify the participants.

## Anonymity

Your name and other contact details are collected by the Mesmerise app but are not supplied to the researchers. Your responses to this survey are therefore anonymous. They may contain some personal characteristics such as age, ethnicity and gender, but there will be no specific personal information such as name and contact details to identify you.

In the initial questionnaire, you will be asked to provide an email address, which will enable us to link your initial questionnaire data to your Mesmerise responses and your response to the final questionnaire. When you communicate with the researcher via email (e.g. to arrange collection of the smartwatch), she will probably also have access to your name, but this will not be recorded anywhere in the research dataset.

Therefore, the only identifiable data the researchers will have access to is your email address. Once data from the initial questionnaire, Mesmerise, and the final questionnaire are linked, email addresses will be deleted from the dataset and participants will be referred to using their unique ID provided by the Mesmerise app. A separate document will contain information linking the Mesmerise ID to the participant email address, but this will be kept separately from the research data and will never be shared. You can contact the researcher or supervisor to request that your data is deleted at any time.

The Data Controller for this research is the University of Exeter. You may contact the Information Governance office of the University of Exeter by emailing ([dataprotection\@exeter.ac.uk](mailto:dataprotection@exeter.ac.uk){.email}).
