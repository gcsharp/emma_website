class="section level1">
<h1><strong>Welcome to EMMA, a study of Women’s Health by the University
of Exeter</strong></h1>
<p>You are invited to take part in this academic research study. Before
you decide whether or not to participate in this study, it is important
that you understand why the research is being done and what it will
involve. Please take the time to read the following information
carefully.</p>
<div id="purpose-of-the-research" class="section level2">
<h2>Purpose of the research</h2>
<p>Compared to research on men, there has been very little research on
the health and wellbeing of women. There is an urgent need to bridge the
gap by collecting more high quality data on women, and conducting more
research to better understand how to maximise their health.</p>
<p>The aim of the EMMA study is to establish whether it is feasible to
use a technique called Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) to collect
data on women’s health for future research. The technique involves using
smart technology (a phone app and a smartwatch) to collect daily
measures of health and wellbeing over a 3-month period.</p>
<p>We want to see how well participants engage with the study, and
understand their experiences of taking part. This will help us
understand whether we need to make any changes to the study protocol
before it is used in future research.</p>
</div>
<div id="who-is-doing-this-research" class="section level2">
<h2>Who is doing this research?</h2>
<p>The lead researcher of this study is Jessica Brookman, an MSc Student
on the Psychological Research Methods course in the Psychology
Department at the University of Exeter. This project is being supervised
by Dr Gemma Sharp, Associate Professor at the University of Exeter.</p>
</div>
<div id="ethical-review-of-this-research" class="section level2">
<h2>Ethical review of this research</h2>
<p>This study has been reviewed and approved by the University of Exeter
Research Ethics Committee. The Chairs of the Ethics Committee may be
contacted by email: Ciro Civile (<a href="mailto:c.civile@ex.ac.uk"
class="email">c.civile@ex.ac.uk</a>) or Ian McLaren (<a
href="mailto:i.p.l.mclaren@ex.ac.uk"
class="email">i.p.l.mclaren@ex.ac.uk</a>)</p>
</div>
<div id="what-participants-will-be-asked-to-do" class="section level2">
<h2>What participants will be asked to do</h2>
<p>The study will take place over a 3-month period, requiring daily
input onto an mobile phone app (Mesmerise), which should take no more
than 5 minutes, twice a day. You will also be asked to wear a smart
watch (provided by the research team), to monitor your heart rate
throughout the study. Therefore, you will need to be local to Exeter to
enable to collection and return of this device (from the Washington
Singer building, Streatham Campus, University of Exeter).</p>
<p>On the next tab, you can check whether you’re eligible to participate
in this study. If you are, you will be asked a series of short questions
designed to gather data on your current physical and mental health. This
should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.</p>
<p>Once we have received this, we will contact you via email to confirm
whether you still want to participate, and we will provide you with a
link to download the Mesmerise smartphone app and join the study. On
Mesmerise, you will be prompted twice a day to complete your daily
questionnaires, and once a week to complete an additional short weekly
questionnaire. Each questionniare should only take a couple of minutes.
We will also arrange (via email) for you to collect a smartwatch. When
you come to collect the smartwatch, we will explain how to use it to
collect heart rate data. We will also explain how you can download the
data and send it to us at the end of the study.</p>
<p>At the end of the 3-month period, you will be asked to complete a
final questionnaire, where we will ask for your honest feedback on what
it was like to be a participant in this study. This will allow us to
guide future research using similar methodology.</p>
<p>All personal data collected will be anonymised and will not be
traceable back to you. Data will be stored in line with GDPR guidelines,
and you can opt-out of having your data stored if you so wish.</p>
</div>
<div id="payment-for-research" class="section level2">
<h2>Payment for research</h2>
<p>We estimate it will take no more than 10 minutes a day to complete
the questionnaires, and the study lasts for three months. If you
participate, you will receive a £10 Amazon voucher on completion. If you
drop out of the study part way through, you will still receive this
payment. However, if you drop out prior to beginning the EMA aspect of
the study, no compensation will be provided.</p>
</div>
<div id="benefits-and-risks-of-taking-part" class="section level2">
<h2>Benefits and risks of taking part</h2>
<p>Participating in this study will aid future research into Women’s
Health, with the hope of improving health outcomes for all women and
people who menstruate. The present research will act as a guide for
future research in this field, so participating in this research will
enable us to learn what works for you as participants to make future
research the best experience possible for participants whilst yielding
good quality data.</p>
<p>There are no direct risks involved with participating in this study.
You should be aware that there is always a potential risk to
confidentiality, but this will be mitigated by all data being anonymised
and securely stored according to GDPR guidelines. Please note that it is
extremely unlikely that there would be any breach of your data, but
should this occur, you will be notified immediately.</p>
</div>
<div id="voluntary-participation-and-your-right-to-withdraw"
class="section level2">
<h2>Voluntary participation and your right to withdraw</h2>
<p>Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You are under
no obligation to take part and you may stop at any time.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-management" class="section level2">
<h2>Data management</h2>
<p>Your data will be fully anonymised prior to the project write-up.
Data will be retained for up to 5 years in line with GDPR guidelines.
Data may be used in future research into Women’s Health. It is most
likely that the data from this project will be used only by the
supervisor of the current project. Any other researchers wishing to use
the Mesmerise data will be required to contact the supervisor. They will
only be granted access if they are a bona fide researcher and their
project is approved by the supervisor and the ethics committee. They
will then sign a data transfer agreement that requires them to respect
the confidential nature of the data and prevents further sharing and any
attempt to identify the participants.</p>
</div>
<div id="anonymity" class="section level2">
<h2>Anonymity</h2>
<p>Your name and other contact details are collected by the Mesmerise
app but are not supplied to the researchers. Your responses to this
survey are therefore anonymous. They may contain some personal
characteristics such as age, ethnicity and gender, but there will be no
specific personal information such as name and contact details to
identify you.</p>
<p>In the initial questionnaire, you will be asked to provide an email
address, which will enable us to link your initial questionnaire data to
your Mesmerise responses and your response to the final questionnaire.
When you communicate with the researcher via email (e.g. to arrange
collection of the smartwatch), she will probably also have access to
your name, but this will not be recorded anywhere in the research
dataset.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only identifiable data the researchers will have
access to is your email address. Once data from the initial
questionnaire, Mesmerise, and the final questionnaire are linked, email
addresses will be deleted from the dataset and participants will be
referred to using their unique ID provided by the Mesmerise app. A
separate document will contain information linking the Mesmerise ID to
the participant email address, but this will be kept separately from the
research data and will never be shared. You can contact the researcher
or supervisor to request that your data is deleted at any time.</p>
<p>The Data Controller for this research is the University of Exeter.
You may contact the Information Governance office of the University of
Exeter by emailing (<a href="mailto:dataprotection@exeter.ac.uk"
